      <h1>How do I change my theme?</h1>
      <ol>
<li>First, if you want to install a new theme, you can do it by finding a theme you like (we have a <a href="https://github.com/nylas/N1">list</a>!) and using `git clone` or downloading the ZIP to your computer. Then, go to "Nylas Mail" -&gt; "Install Theme..." in the menu and choose the directory for your theme. It should automatically become your active theme once it's installed.<br /><br /><img src="https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205867367/Screen_Shot_2016-03-11_at_2.57.17_PM.png" alt="" width="276" height="147" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>If you want to change your theme to another theme you have installed, go to "Nylas Mail" -&gt; "Change Theme..." in the menu.<br /><br /> <img src="https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205867397/Screen_Shot_2016-03-11_at_3.01.05_PM.png" alt="" width="276" height="121" /><br /><br /></li>
<li>The theme picker shows all of the themes you have installed. Just click the one you want to change the theme!<br /><br /> <img src="https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/205853368/Screen_Shot_2016-03-11_at_3.03.08_PM.png" alt="" width="276" height="432" /><br /><br /></li>
