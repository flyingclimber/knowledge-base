      <h1>Can I create or modify contacts through Nylas Mail?</h1>
      <p>Right now, Nylas Mail's contacts integration only allows you to use contacts from Google or Microsoft Exchange when addressing emails. Nylas Mail does not yetÂ support adding, modifying, or deleting contacts, or integration with other contact providers such as iCloud or Yahoo.</p>
