      <h1>How do I enable the "All Mail" folder?</h1>
      <p><strong>Error message:</strong> "Your accountÂ is missing the 'All Mail' folder. This is probably due to 'Show in IMAP' being disabled."</p>
<p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Your Gmail account doesn't have an "All Mail" folder, preventing the Nylas Sync Engine from syncing it. Thankfully, it's easy to enable it!</p>
<p>To do it, you'll just need to sign in to Gmail from a web browser, go to <a href="https://mail.google.com/mail/#settings/labels">Settings / Labels</a> and check "Show in IMAP" next to "All Mail."</p>
