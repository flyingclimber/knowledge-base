      <h1>I'm getting "Invalid Credentials" when connecting an Outlook.com account.</h1>
      <p>If you've verified that your email and password are correct, Microsoft may be blocking your N1 login attempts with a security challenge.</p>
<p>To resolve the problem, visitÂ <a href="https://account.live.com/activity">account.live.com/activity</a>. If your account is affected, you'll see a "Security challenge" section like in the screenshot below. (You'll need to click the header to display all details!)</p>
<p><img src="https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/204757277/live_com_security.png" alt="" />Click the "This is me" button, then try connecting your account to N1 again.</p>
