      <h1>Managing your inbox with mail rules</h1>
      <p>Set up and manage mail rules at Preferences &gt; Mail Rules.</p>
<p>Mail rules help you manage your inbox more easily by automating the handling of certain incoming messages.</p>
<p>To set up a new mail rule, define the conditions you want to use to select messages, then define the action (or actions) you want to take on messages that meet the criteria.</p>

<p> </p>
<p>By default, mail rules are applied to incoming mail as it arrives. If you’d like to apply a new rule to your entire inbox immediately after you create it, you can click “Process entire inbox.” This processing may take some time depending on the size of your inbox.</p>
