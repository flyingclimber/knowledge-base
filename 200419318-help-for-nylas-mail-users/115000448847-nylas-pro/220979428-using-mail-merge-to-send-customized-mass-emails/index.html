      <h1>Using mail merge to send customized mass emails</h1>
      <p>Mail merge lets you create a message template, then automatically fill in variables to make each message personal.</p>
<p>Follow these steps:<br /> </p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Compose the message</strong> you’d like to send, either by writing it directly in the text editor or by choosing an existing template.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Click the Mass Email icon.</strong> A table will appear below your message. This is where you add the content that will be inserted into your message when it’s sent. <br /><br /> All mail merge messages must use email as one variable; this is the list of addresses to which your message will be sent. To add more variables, click the “+” on the right and a new column will appear. Add the name of the each variable in the top row.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Populate the variables table</strong>, either directly (just click on each cell and type) or by importing a CSV file.<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Drag and drop your variables into place</strong> where you want them to appear within the message.<br /><br /></li>
</ol>
<p>You can preview how the message will look for each recipient by clicking the rows in the table.</p>
<p>In order to respect the limits of the majority of email providers, Nylas will allow you to send mail merge messages to up to 150 recipients at a time.</p>
