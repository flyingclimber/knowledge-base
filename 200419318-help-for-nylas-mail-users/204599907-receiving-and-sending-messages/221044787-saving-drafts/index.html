      <h1>Saving drafts</h1>
      <p>Unsent drafts will be auto-saved to the Drafts folder as you write. You can view drafts for each of your accounts separately or together.</p>
<p>Any messages youâ€™ve scheduled using the Send Later function will also be saved to your Drafts folder. You can edit the message at any point before the scheduled send time.</p>
