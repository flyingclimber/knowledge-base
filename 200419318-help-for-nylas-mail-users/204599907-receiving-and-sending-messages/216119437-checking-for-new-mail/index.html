      <h1>Checking for new mail</h1>
      <p>Nylas Mail continuously syncs with the mail server, so messages appear as soon as they’re available on the server. Nylas Mail will automatically reconnect and sync after being disconnected.</p>
<p>If you lose your connection, Nylas Mail will display an alert at the top of your window. </p>
<p>We are looking into ways of improving offline status indicators in the future so it's more clear whether Nylas Mail is actively syncing your mail.</p>
