      <h1>Offline account access</h1>
      <p>Nylas Mail allows you to read, compose, and schedule messages as usual while offline.</p>
<p>Your ability to see images and attachments while offline depends on how you’ve configured Nylas to download attachments. These are your options:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>When received</strong> provides maximum readability and access while offline</li>
<li><strong>When read</strong> means you will only be able to view images and attachments you have previously opened if you go offline</li>
<li><strong>Manually</strong></li>
</ul>

<p> </p>
<p>Messages you send while offline will be queued and sent when you reconnect to the internet.</p>
