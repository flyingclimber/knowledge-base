      <h1>Supported languages</h1>
      <p>Nylas Mail currently supports only English (US), but we are looking into adding support for other languages, including RTL languages, soon.</p>
<p>If you are interested in volunteering for translations, check out this GitHub issue: <a href="https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues/24">https://github.com/nylas/N1/issues/24</a>. As soon as we can put a scaffold in place for language contributions, we'llÂ let you know how you can help.</p>
