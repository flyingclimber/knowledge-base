      <h1>Using and customizing keyboard shortcuts</h1>
      <p>N1 comes pre-loaded with several common keyboard shortcut configurations. Go to Preferences &gt; Shortcuts to change the set it uses.</p>
<p><img src="https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208505067/keyboard_shortcuts.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Â </p>
<p>If you want even more specific control over your keyboard shortcuts, you can edit a file that will override any defaults.</p>
<p>On Mac and Linux, edit the file at: "~/.nylas/keymap.json"</p>
<p>On Windows the file should be at: "C:\Users\Your Name\.nylas\keymap.json". The ".nylas" folder is hidden and you may need to go to View &gt; Hidden Items.</p>
<p>If the file doesn't exist, simply make one called "keymap.json" in the ".nylas" folder.</p>
<p>You can then enter a mapping between a sequence of keys and an action to take. See the following two examples for the exact syntax to use and the available commands:</p>
<ol>
<li>Here are all of the default keymaps used in N1: <a href="https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/keymaps/base.json">https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/keymaps/base.json</a><br /><br /></li>
<li>Here are more keymaps for those that have Gmail-style keymaps enabled: <a href="https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/keymaps/templates/Gmail.json">https://github.com/nylas/N1/blob/master/keymaps/templates/Gmail.json</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Any entries you add to your own "~/.nylas/keymap.json" file will override the defaults. Use the same syntax as the two example files above. The list of available actions can be found in the example files.</p>
<p>Take careful note that in the examples, keyboard shortcuts are scoped under "body:" or "'body *[contenteditable].contenteditable':". You must also scope your custom keyboard shortcuts under the appropriate heading (see examples).</p>
