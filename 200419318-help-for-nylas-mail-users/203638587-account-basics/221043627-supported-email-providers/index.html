      <h1>Supported email providers</h1>
      <p>Nylas Mail supports the largest email providers. Supported services include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Gmail / Google Apps / G Suite</li>
<li>Microsoft Office 365 / Outlook.com</li>
<li>Yahoo</li>
<li>iCloud</li>
<li>FastMail</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also add most IMAP / SMTP providers to Nylas Mail via the "Add Custom IMAP Account..." option inside the main menu bar.  However, we cannot ensure that Nylas Mail will correctly find and display all your emails and folders with custom IMAP providers - each one is set up differently, and while Nylas Mail does the best it can, we cannot ensure that it will work perfectly.  If you are setting up your own custom IMAP server, please use the default settings as much as possible.</p>
<p>Nylas Pro also adds support for Microsoft Exchange.  </p>
<p>Nylas Mail does not support connecting to accounts via POP / POP3. The vast majority of mail providers that support POP3 also support the newer, better IMAP standard. </p>
