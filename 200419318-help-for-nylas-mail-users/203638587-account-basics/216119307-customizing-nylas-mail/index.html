      <h1>Customizing Nylas Mail</h1>
      <p>Nylas Mail is designed from the ground up to be customized and extended. There are several ways you can do this:</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Install plugins</span></p>
<p>Plugins add new functionality to Nylas Mail. You can <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/221043467-Activating-plugins">activate</a> or deactivate them at any time. More than a dozen plugins are built in directly to Nylas Mail. Go to Preferences &gt; Plugins to see a list of what’s available, then toggle to install.</p>
<p>Developers can clone or download additional Nylas Mail plugins via <a href="https://github.com/nylas/n1#plugin-list">GitHub</a>. Many of these plugins are community-contributed, and the selection will continue to grow over time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Install custom themes</span></p>
<p>The design of Nylas Mail is customizable. Choose from several prebuilt <a href="/hc/en-us/articles/217557858-How-do-I-change-my-theme-">themes</a> in Preferences &gt; Appearance, or download and install new themes <a href="https://github.com/nylas/n1">here</a>. And if you’re familiar with CSS, you can create your own!</p>
<p> </p>
<p><span class="wysiwyg-font-size-large">Adjust your preferences</span></p>
<p>From the standard Preferences panel, you can change settings like the display mode, how unread counts are shown, notification settings, sounds, and many others.</p>
<p> </p>
