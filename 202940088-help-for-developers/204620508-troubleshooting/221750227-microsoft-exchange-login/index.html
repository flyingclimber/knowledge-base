      <h1>Microsoft Exchange Login</h1>
      <p>You should usually be able to log in via Exchange using your email address and password. If you have two-factor authentication enabled on your account, you'll need to generate an app password, and you can use Microsoft's <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/12409/microsoft-account-app-passwords-two-step-verification">instructions</a> for how to do that. If you see an error message, you should try one of the following things.</p>
<p><strong>Specifying a username</strong></p>
<p>If your email address (eg. <code>tony@nylanauts.com</code>) is not the same as the username you use to log on to Windows, try entering your Windows username in the ‘Exchange username’ box. It may look like an email address <code>tony@login.nylanauts.com</code> or be in a <code>DOMAIN\username</code> format, eg.<code>NYLANAUTS\tony:</code></p>

<p>If this box is left empty, your email address will be used.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Specifying an Exchange server</strong></p>
<p>N1 auto-detects most Exchange server names, but sometimes you will need to enter the server details manually.</p>
<p>If you have access to Outlook Web App for your email, the server name you see when logged in is the correct one. For example, this Office365 user sees <code>outlook.office365.com</code> when logged in:</p>
<p><img class="wysiwyg-text-align-center" src="https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/article_attachments/208802968/office_addressbar.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you're in doubt, ask your Exchange server administrator about the exact domain name of your company server.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Connection issues</strong></p>
<p>If you are sure the details are correct but login is failing, this may be due to connection issues. Please make sure you have not entered a server name that requires VPN access.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Extra help</strong></p>
<p>Sometimes the username and server details are all correct, but syncing an account still fails. This is rare and we recommend you <a href="mailto:support@nylas.com">contact support</a> with a detailed description of the issue you are experiencing.</p>
