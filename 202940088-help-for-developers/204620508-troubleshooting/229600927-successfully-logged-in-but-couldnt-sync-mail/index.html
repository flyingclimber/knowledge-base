      <h1>Successfully logged in but couldn't sync mail</h1>
      <p>If a user ever sees "Successfully logged in but couldn't sync mail" after authenticating their account there are a couple of issues that might need to be fixed.</p>
<p>This error message generally means that mobile device provisioning isn't enabled or that there is a security challenge that the user needs to approve in order to sync mail (in the case of outlook.com accounts).</p>
<p>I'd recommend making sure mobile device provisioning is enabled, asking about the security challenge [see this help article](https://support.nylas.com/hc/en-us/articles/216108087-I-m-getting-Invalid-Credentials-when-connecting-an-Outlook-com-account-) and also seeing if connecting from other mail clients works.</p>
<p>If a user can successfully sync mail from other clients, then please reach out to support@nylas.com and we can help troubleshoot.</p>
