      <h1>What is the Nylas Sync Engine and how can I use it?</h1>
      <p>The Nylas Sync Engine is the core of the Nylas platform. It's the primary interface with mail providers, used to sync mail and perform actions. It also exposes a beautiful modern JSON API that allows developers to quickly build email apps.</p>
<p>The code to this is currently available as <a href="https://github.com/nylas/inbox">open source free software</a> that can be run by developers on any service. The Nylas Developer Program provides a fully managed and scalable service for production deployment. Sign up <a>here</a>.</p>
<p>To set up a development VM, see the <a href="https://nylas.com/docs/gettingstarted">installation instructions</a>. We also provide pre-built SDKs for <a href="https://github.com/nylas/inbox-ios">iOS</a> and <a href="https://github.com/nylas/inbox.js">JavaScript</a> to help you get started building apps. Full details on this and more can be found in the <a href="https://nylas.com/docs">Nylas API Developer Documentation.</a></p>
