      <h1>How does this compare to the Gmail API?</h1>
      <p>Gmail offers a modern, restful API, but it is closed platform. Applications built on the Gmail API will only work with Gmail.</p>
<p>Nylas is designed to be easily extensible to all email providers. The open source license means that developers are free to run the Nylas Sync Engine anywhere, and build any sort of API integration they please.</p>
