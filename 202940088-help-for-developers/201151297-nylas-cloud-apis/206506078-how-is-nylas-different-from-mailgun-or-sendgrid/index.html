      <h1>How is Nylas different from Mailgun or Sendgrid?</h1>
      <p>Nylas allows you to access mail data inside the mailboxes of your users. For example, you could use Nylas to build an app showing detail from all the flight confirmation messages a user received last year. Transactional mail services like Mailgun, Sendgrid, or Amazon SES are an interface for sending mail from your app's address (e.g.: no-reply@example.com).</p>
