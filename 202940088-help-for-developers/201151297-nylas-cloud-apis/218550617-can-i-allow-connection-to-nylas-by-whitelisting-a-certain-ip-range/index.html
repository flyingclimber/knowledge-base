      <h1>Can I allow connection to Nylas by whitelisting a certain IP range?</h1>
      <p dir="auto">The Nylas hosted service runs on AWS and currently does not use stable IPs. Nylas connects on all ranges designated "us-west-2" in the JSON file provided here: <a href="http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html</a>. </p>
<p dir="auto">While technically possible to create a whitelist in your firewall to allow the sync engine to connect to your email server, this IP range is very broad.</p>
