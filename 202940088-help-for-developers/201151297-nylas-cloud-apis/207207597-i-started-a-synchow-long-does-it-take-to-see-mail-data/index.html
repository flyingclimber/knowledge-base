      <h1>I started a syncâ€”how long does it take to see mail data?</h1>
      <p>When you link an account to Nylas, it could take anywhere from a few minutes to a few days to build a complete cache of your mailbox. However, the Sync Engine is designed to pull recent messages first, so you should be able to get going quickly. Total sync time will be dependent on factors like total number of messages, your network bandwidth, processing power, and email provider's throttling.</p>
